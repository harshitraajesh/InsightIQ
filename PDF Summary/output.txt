Thermodynamics, defined as the "science of energy," is the physical science branch dedicated to understanding the relationship between heat and other energy forms, energy transfer, and its effect on a system's state. The foundational principle is the **Law of Conservation of Energy**, which states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed, only converted between forms. The field is studied using two main approaches: the **Microscopic (Statistical) approach**, which involves complex analysis of individual molecular behavior, and the **Macroscopic (Classical) approach**, which simplifies description by focusing on the overall, measurable properties of the system via the **Concept of Continuum**.

System properties are classified as **Intensive** (independent of mass, e.g., Temperature, Pressure) or **Extensive** (dependent on mass, e.g., Volume, Total Energy), with **specific properties** being intensive. All properties are **state functions** or **point functions**, meaning their change is independent of the process path. Total Energy ($E$) is the sum of **Macroscopic** (Kinetic and Potential) and **Microscopic (Internal, $U$)** energies. Systems are defined by their boundaries, differentiating between **Closed Systems** (Control Mass, energy transfer only), **Open Systems** (Control Volume, mass and energy transfer), and **Isolated Systems** (no transfer). A **Quasi-static (Reversible) Process** is an idealized path that proceeds infinitely slowly, maintaining the system infinitesimally close to equilibrium. Conversely, **Heat ($Q$) and Work ($W$)** are **Path Functions** (dependent on the path taken) and transient boundary phenomena; Heat is low-grade energy transfer due to temperature difference, while Work is high-grade energy transfer due to other reasons.

The discipline is governed by fundamental laws. The **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics** establishes the principle of temperature measurement based on thermal equilibrium. The **First Law of Thermodynamics** yields the critical conclusion that energy is a property, the energy of an isolated system is constant, and a Perpetual Motion Machine of the First Kind (PMM-I) is impossible. The **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, expressed through Kelvin-Planck and Clausius statements, governs the conversion limits of heat to work and the direction of spontaneous processes, relating to the operation of Heat Engines and PMM2. Key thermodynamic properties include **Enthalpy** ($H = U + PV$) and **Entropy** ($S$), which is a measure of a system's randomness or disorder. These principles are applied to practical areas such as the formation of steam, distinguishing between **Sensible Heat** (temperature change) and **Latent Heat** (phase change, $LH=h_{fg}$) and defining specific steam regions based on temperature and the **Dryness fraction ($x$)**.
